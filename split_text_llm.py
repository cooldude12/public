                You are an AI language model. Your primary task is to intelligently segment customer feedback based on distinct themes. Follow the guidelines below:
                Direct Extraction: Extract and segment the original feedback text without altering or adding any words. The output should be direct fragments from the input, and you should not generate new content.
                Distinct Themes: Each segment of the feedback should represent a singular theme. If there's a distinct shift in theme within a feedback, split it into separate sets. However, be mindful of subtle connections in the feedback. For example, a feedback like 'I hated the pizza as the crust was too hard' has a single theme, even though it mentions both the pizza and the crust.
                No Split for Strongly Connected Themes: If the entire feedback revolves around a closely related or singular theme, it remains intact. For example, 'I hated the pizza because the crust was too hard' should not be split, as it revolves around the overall dissatisfaction with the pizza.

                Formatting Requirements:

                Do not use bullet points or numbering.
                Convert emojis or non-ASCII characters to descriptive text.
                Context Consideration: Use the accompanying question text (if provided) to better contextualize the feedback's theme(s).

                Input Data Context: {context} 

                It's essential to understand the interconnectedness of the themes and ensure that feedback about 
                closely related experiences isn't unnecessarily split.
                Format: 
                Question: {question_text}
                Feedback: {review_text}
                Based on the above, extract the themes and format your output as a clean, one-line JSON array: ["<theme1>", "<theme2>", ...]

                Examples:

                Input: "The pizza was delicious but the delivery was super late."
                Output: ["The pizza was delicious", "The delivery was super late."]

                Input: "I hated the pizza because the crust was too hard."
                Output: ["I hated the pizza because the crust was too hard."]

                Input: "The cashier line was  long, I waited for a long time."
                Output: ["The cashier line was  long, I waited for a long time"]

                Input: "baggers were bad, did not help at all."
                Output: ["baggers were bad, did not help at all"]

                ''
                Use the examples to guide your segmentation. If the feedback elements are strongly interrelated, keep them unified.

"""
            You are an AI language model. Your task is to split a feedback if the feedback has multiple themes. 
            Each subset of the feedback should have only one theme. A subset can have one or more sentences.
            If the entire review has one theme, then it should NOT split into sentences. But it has multiple 
            themes, you should NOT have only one set, but multiple sets
            
            For example, if the feedback is: "The pizza was delicious, but the delivery was super late. 
            The delivery guy arrived two hours late", the subsets will be "The pizza was delicious" and  
            "The delivery was super late. The delivery guy arrived two hours late".

            A second example that has same theme, where it should NOT split the feedback. 
            "The pizza was horrible.  It was cold and very less toppings".  The output will be only one set
            "The pizza was horrible.  It was cold and very less toppings".

            Other things to take care of for the label
            1. sice a label represents only one theme, it should not have numbering or bullet points
            2. should not have emojis.  if emoji or similar non-ascii chars are present at source, 
               the emotion need to be converted to text
            
            You can also look at the question text if present to decide if there is one theme or multiple
            thems in the review. 
            
            Here is the input data for feedback:
            The question asked was: {question_text}
            The feedback given was: {review_text}

            Please split the above feedback into subsets according to the themes.
            The output should be a well-formatted JSON as ["<subset11>", "<subset12>", "<subset3>"] 
            and will be in a single line.
           
            You are an AI language model. Your primary task is to intelligently split customer feedback based on distinct themes. Follow the guidelines below:

            One Theme, One Set: Each subset of the feedback should represent a singular theme. If there's a distinct shift in theme within a feedback, split it into separate sets.

            No Split for Singular Themes: If the entire feedback revolves around a singular theme, it remains intact. However, if there are multiple themes, you must segregate them.

            Detailed Examples:

            Multi-theme Feedback: "The pizza was delicious, but the delivery was super late. The delivery person arrived two hours behind schedule." This feedback has two themes:
            The quality of the pizza.
            The tardiness of the delivery.
            Single-theme Feedback: "The pizza was undercooked and cold when delivered." This feedback has one theme: The unsatisfactory quality of the pizza.
            Formatting Requirements:

            Avoid bullet points or numbering.
            Convert emojis or non-ASCII characters to descriptive text.
            Context Consideration: Take cues from the accompanying question text (if provided) to better contextualize the feedback's theme(s).

            Input Data Format:

            Question: {question_text}
            Feedback: {review_text}
